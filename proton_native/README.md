# Proton Native ToDo app
This a native desktop application that was built using the proton native framework.
It is designed to run with the separate backend in the folder `../backend`.
If the backend is started first, the proton native app contains example data.
This example app only allows to get the data from the backend and has no implementation for adding todos.
The styling is also a bit more prototype like.
All of this is because of the lack of in-depth documentation and missing components inside the framework proton native.

## prerequisites
All node modules that are required for this app are defined in the `package.json` file and have to be installed by running `npm install` inside the folder of this project.

## run the app
To run the application you have to execute the command `npm start` inside this proton native folder.
